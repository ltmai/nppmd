# nppmd - View and edit Markdown in Notepad++

Notepad++ is powerful.

Notepad++ supports syntax highlight languages. Since Markdown is a little more than 
plain text, highlighting some parts of the text would not be enough. But we try to
make Notepad++ be more friendly to Markdown so you can use it to view/edit Markdown

The first idea is to make personal notes in Notepad++ less tedious, so you still
have both colorful highlighted text and advantage of searching your notes in plain
text.

Taking notes in Markdown with Notepad++
- markdown is simple and easy to read, it is very close to plain text.
- your note is highlighted and can be viewed as Markdown but still in plain text.
